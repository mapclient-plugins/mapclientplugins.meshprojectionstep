Workflow Setup
--------------

To setup a mesh projection workflow, add a **File Chooser** step (or another step that provides a `Zinc` mesh EX file) and a **Mesh Projection** step to the workflow area.
Edit the **File Chooser** step configuration to specify the `Zinc` EX file that defines the mesh to be projected.
Once this step has been configured, connect its output port to the input port of the **Mesh Projection** step - as in :ref:`Fig. 1 <fig-mesh-projection-workflow>`.
The mesh projection step will be configured by default as it doesn't have any configuration settings to be set.
What you connect the **Mesh Projection** step output port to depends on your objective.
In :ref:`Fig. 1 <fig-mesh-projection-workflow>` we have connected the output port to a **File Location Sink** step - allowing us to define a local directory where the output file will be saved.

Once we have the workflow set up, save it and click the `Execute` button to start the **Mesh Projection** GUI.
